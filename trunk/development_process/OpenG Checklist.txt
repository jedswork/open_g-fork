has 2D Controls?

are references labeled "{object-name}" and "{object-name} out"?

are the controls and indicators right alligned?

are all the controls and indicator labels lower-case?

Does the class have a puble "not a {object-name}" or "object status" VI?

Does each VI have an "[OpenG VI Tags] ***Do Not Remove***" floating label?

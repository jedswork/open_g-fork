-= Decisions =-

* VI belongs in the Numeric Palette/Library (as opposed to the Array Palette/Library)

* Will use the "Numeric Primitive-like" Icon (triangle with X-bar)

* Show polymorphic selector, by default, to make it clear which member is being used and that there are other poly options.  Users can easily hide this to save diagram realestate

* 2D array in members should have icon with brackets around the X-bar to indicate that the output is an array of averages

* Poly member labels and menus should use Title Case

* Poly member labels should be "of Rows" and "of Columns"

* 1D in, scalar out member output indicator should be labelled "arithmetic mean"

* 2D in, 1D out members output indicator should be labelled "arithmetic mean of rows" and "arithmetic mean of columns"

* Use 3x3 icon to facilitate primitive-like icon/connector

* VI Names: "Arithmetic Mean.vi" - "(2D Rows)", "(2D Columns)"

* Code will be developed in 8.2.  We'll see how much push-back we get.

* Drop NaN/Inf filtering because this is easy done.

* No error handling: Output NaN when empty array in

* Drop "rows and columns" (2D in, scalar out) since there is really no practical use case for it.  Also, there is no mathematical basis or experience for using it.

* Drop integer, SGL, EXT types, so that we can use poly for selecting behavior.  There is not enough demand for these types.


-= Other Notes =-

* This is a perfect candidate for XNodes. However, since XNodes are not officially supported by NI, this is a bad path for OpenG to go down.  We want OpenG libraries to be rock-solid.

* Users needing Fixed-point, EXT, 64-bit support users can be expected to have thier own analysis libraries.

* Candidate page it should have:

  ** indicator of what stage the candidate is in

  ** history

  ** information about who is working on it and what role they place

* Numbered proposals are better than named proposals, because we might want to rename VIs (or the name might not even be know, at that point)


-= Action Items =-

* Jim will look into Chris's sf.net SVN permissions

1) Jim will send meeting notes to meeting participants to use for next steps (3/25)

2) Justin should update the functional spec by early next week (EOD Monday, 3/31)

3) Chris should update the candidate code (EOD Friday, 4/4)

4) Justin will post to OpenG forum (Sat, 4/5)

5) Jim will try to pull people into the discussion (Sat, 4/5)
